Generally, if you hold the asset for more than one year before you dispose of it, your capital gain or loss is long-term. If you hold it one year or less, your capital gain or loss is short-term. For exceptions to this rule, such as property acquired by gift, property acquired from a decedent, or patent property, refer to Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets; for commodity futures, see Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses; or for applicable partnership interests, see Publication 541, Partnerships. To determine how long you held the asset, you generally count from the day after the day you acquired the asset up to and including the day you disposed of the asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a net capital gain, a lower tax rate may apply to the gain than the tax rate that applies to your ordinary income. The term \"net capital gain\" means the amount by which your net long-term capital gain for the year is more than your net short-term capital loss for the year. The term \"net long-term capital gain\" means long-term capital gains reduced by long-term capital losses including any unused long-term capital loss carried over from previous years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital Gain Tax Rates\n",
    "The tax rate on most net capital gain is no higher than 15% for most individuals. Some or all net capital gain may be taxed at 0% if your taxable income is less than or equal to $40,400 for single or $80,800 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er).\n",
    "\n",
    "A capital gain rate of 15% applies if your taxable income is more than $40,400 but less than or equal to $445,850 for single; more than $80,800 but less than or equal to $501,600 for married filing jointly or qualifying widow(er); more than $54,100 but less than or equal to $473,750 for head of household or more than $40,400 but less than or equal to $250,800 for married filing separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a net capital gain tax rate of 20% applies to the extent that your taxable income exceeds the thresholds set for the 15% capital gain rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other exceptions where capital gains may be taxed at rates greater than 20%:\n",
    "\n",
    "The taxable part of a gain from selling section 1202 qualified small business stock is taxed at a maximum 28% rate.\n",
    "Net capital gains from selling collectibles (such as coins or art) are taxed at a maximum 28% rate.\n",
    "The portion of any unrecaptured section 1250 gain from selling section 1250 real property is taxed at a maximum 25% rate.\n",
    "Note: Net short-term capital gains are subject to taxation as ordinary income at graduated tax rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit on the Deduction and Carryover of Losses\n",
    "If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on line 16 of Schedule D (Form 1040). Claim the loss on line 7 of your Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR. If your net capital loss is more than this limit, you can carry the loss forward to later years. You may use the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet found in Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses or in the Instructions for Schedule D (Form 1040)PDF to figure the amount you can carry forward.\n",
